This repository contains the RSS measurements obtained by mounting 4 receivers on the ceiling of the warehouse. The corresponding dataset can be found at RSS_data.csv and the average noise floor measurement for each channel is given in avg_noise.csv. 

The features in the dataset are as follows:

Pyn: y channel signal strength read by receiver n.

Pzn: z channel signal strength read by receiver n.

time: time elapsed after the start of the measurements (separate for each line).

tag_height: height of the tag from the ground in meters.

frequency: frequency of the transmitted signal in MHz.

tx_x: x coordinate of the transmitter in meters.

tx_y: y coordinate of the transmitter in meters.

rxn_x: x coordinate of receiver n in meters.

rxn_y: y coordinate of receiver n in meters.


x: x coordinate of the tag in meters.

y: y coordinate of the tag in meters.

distance: distance of the tag in meters (separate for each line).
